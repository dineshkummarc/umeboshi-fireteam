    <h2>Have you ever seen a label like that? &nbsp;âžŸ</h2>
    <p>
      It means the author of the page have made it in a way that allows you to distribute interface elements over multiple devices. Mobile ones included! Check <a href="/demos/video/">some</a> wicked <a href="/demos/music/">stuff</a>!

    <h2>How is that possible?</h2>
    <p>
      The concept is quite simple: if humans can exchange messages in a chat room, why couldn't websites? In practice, we've built a special kind of <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> server from which you can request a channel and name some participants. From that point, it's up to the author define what the pieces of his UI will chat about ;) <a href="http://github.com/nko/umeboshi-fireteam#readme">Check out proto-documentation here.</a> Or by doing view-source on a demo.

    <h2>Can I use it in my website or app?</h2>
    <p>
      Sure! The project was born during the <a href="http://nodeknockout.com">Node Knockout</a> event (a 48-hour-do-what-you-want/can-competition) so expect some unpolished/untested stuff. Aware of that, tell your site/app to follow the step below and you should be good to go:
      <ol>
        <li>Access the request channel page</li>
        <li>Tell it how many UI elements will participate in the channel</li>
        <li>Tell them who should they listen to</li>
        <li>Teach them to understand each other</li>
      </ol>
    <p>
    Let us hope community will help each other in the <a href="http://groups.google.com.br/group/umeboshi-team">forums.</a>

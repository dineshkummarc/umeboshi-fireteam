    <h2>Thank you message from the Umeboshi Fireteam</h2>
    <p>
      We have received lots of <a href="http://nodeknockout.com/teams/umeboshi-fireteam">great feedback</a> from the NodeKO Judges, Participants and voters. 
      Thanks to your reviews we managed to figure out in the <a href="http://nodeknockout.com/teams#innovation">top 5 of the Innovation category</a>.
      <strong>Thatâ€™s awesome!</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      As a consequence of that, we are now building a new and improved home page, as well as more examples and demos. 
      So please bear with us while the new website is not ready. 
      The old home page can still be accessed <a href="knockout-home.html">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The channels server and the REST API are still up and running which means that the existing demos and any new ones that people were possibly developing that uses them still work ok.
      But please do not use them for any real-world application because the API can and will change.
    </p>
    <h2>Help us take this to the next level</h2>
    <p>
      We want to continue developing this project, since we think it is relevant and cool. But we also have our daily lives to manage :)
    </p>
    <p>
      The Umeboshi Fireteam is not a company, just a group of friends. Free thinking developers from Brazil that have other commitments of their own. 
      Our group is a mix of freelancers, student, unemployed and employed people, and while we would love to be able/sponsored to focus deeply 
      into this project, for now we are working on it on our spare time and coordinating the tasks over the mailing list. Which means that the help from the community is vital.
    </p>
    <p>
      So please, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/umeboshi-team">join our group</a> to be part of the conversation, 
      <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=dDF1cnYzWldDUTBGbUZpWkJ2aG90REE6MQ">fill this form</a> to leave a comment and be notified of important updates and releases, or simply follow the <a href="http://github.com/nko/umeboshi-fireteam">git repository</a> to watch the updates as they happen.

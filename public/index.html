        <h3 class='title'>Have you ever seen a label like this?</h3>
        <p class="text">It means the author of the page have made it in a way that allows you to distribute interface elements over multiple devices. Mobile ones included! <a href="#">Check some wicked stuff here!</a> <p>
        <h3 class='title'>How is that possible?</h3>
        <p class="text">The concept is quite simple: if humans can exchange messages in a chat room, why couldn't websites? In practice, we've built a special kind of <a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> server from which you can request a channel and name some participants. From that point, it's up to the author define what the pieces of his UI will chat about ;) <a href="#">Check out proto-documentation here.</a></p>
        <h3 class='title'>Can I use it in my website or app?</h3>
        <p class="text">Sure! The project was born during the <a href="http://nodeknockout.com">Node Knockout</a> event (a 48-hour-do-what-you-want/can-competition) so expect some unpolished/untested stuff. Aware of that, tell your site/app to follow the step below and you should be good to go:</p>
        <ol class="text">
          <li>Access the request channel page</li>
          <li>Tell it how many UI elements will participate in the channel</li>
          <li>Tell them who should they listen to</li>
          <li>Teach them to understand each other</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="text">Let us hope community will help each other in the <a href="http://groups.google.com.br/group/umeboshi-team">forums.</a></p>
        <h3 class='title'>Who did it?</h3>
